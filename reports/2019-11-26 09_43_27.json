Dark Web Links    Usenet - NNTP Server   Is Now Active    All News Groups Update On The Fly.  (In Real Time) Full Report\n» Child Pornography and Selfies: What You Need to Know This emerging technology is a natural fit for most teens and, generally, the worst offense they might commit is sharing too frequently. There is, however, also a potential for criminal liability under child pornography laws when selfies involve underage nudity or sexual situations. Definition of Child Pornography Since technology moves much faster than legislation, crimes committed via social media are often prosecuted by applying existing statutes. Federal law defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, and the United States Department of Justice may prosecute offenses occurring across state or international borders and almost any offense involving the Internet. Federal charges need not be exclusive, however, and an individual may face criminal liability under both U.S. and state child pornography laws, which are largely similar to and sometimes more comprehensive than the federal statutes. Many states further define elements of the crime, such as what constitutes sexually explicit conduct or who is considered a minor. For example: Application of Child Pornography Laws to Selfies If an adult takes a sexually explicit picture of a minor and shares it via social media or text message, that adult will likely have run afoul of some child pornography laws. But what about a minor who takes selfies and sends them discreetly to another teen? What if the receiver then forwards the photos to others? Have they violated any laws? In many states, the answer is yes. Though their laws were created to protect minors from exploitation caused by others, states are prosecuting minors under child pornography statutes for sending nude or otherwise lurid self-portraits, even when the minors sent the selfies without coercion. The common quirk in the laws is that there is no exception for taking or distributing sexually explicit pictures of oneself. Thus, a high school student sending a racy seflie to a boyfriend or girlfriend could subject both themselves and the receiver to prosecution for child pornography. If the picture makes its way around other social circles through online or direct sharing, anyone who received or distributed the photo could also find themselves open to charges. Direction of Future Laws The overall trend on both the federal and state levels is toward broader definitions of child pornography with increased prosecutions and harsher penalties for those connected to it. One of the gray areas that's getting greater attention in the age of social media is what constitutes \"possession\" of child pornography. Most social media sites can now store large caches of images indefinitely on the Internet, lessening the need for viewers to download files to their computers. Other services, such as Snapchat, can be used to distribute selfies that auto-delete themselves after a few seconds (though the receiver may create a screen capture before the image disappears). Since merely viewing child pornography is illegal in many states, browsing a website or knowingly receiving illegal images would be criminal activity in those jurisdictions. Other states' child pornography laws, however, have \"possession\" requirements that are somewhat archaic in the digital age. The shortcomings of these statutes were exemplified by a pair of high court decisions from Oregon and New York: Both of these states and others have since taken steps to close such loopholes and expand the reach of their child pornography laws so as to include developing and future technologies, but this is an area of law that is rapidly evolving to meet the times. For teens sending or exchanging risqué pictures, their concern can no longer be limited to whether it may bring embarrassment or even parental and academic discipline. Instead, they need to also consider whether that sexually explicit selfie can get them prosecuted under child pornography laws."

No podemos asegurar que sea culpa de las lauchas que habitan en YouTube o redes sociales, pero la realidad es que cualquier teoría salida del ojete de cualquier Anon se acuña como real sin analizar demasiado. Lejos de aclarar mecanismos y características, lo que se logra es agregar un manto de misterio casi mágico sobre el asunto. No es de extrañar que los noticieros (hispanos, al menos) informen basura, siendo que sus fuentes son lo publicado en internet. Lo que están leyendo, es un intento de aclarar varios de los mitos y las conspiranoias popularizadas en foros y blogs de lauchas y mitómanos. Los niveles Se dice que la web profunda está dividida en niveles -específicamente en cinco niveles, y no se está seguro que no hallan más, en lo profundo. Este mito se representa con la imagen del iceberg. Se teorizan que en los primeros tres niveles  (0 a 2) se concentra gran parte de la red conocida (redes sociales, blogs, foros, hostings, etc.); en los niveles 3 a 4 se consideran niveles medios (virus, scrips, comunidades de hackers, suicidios, servidores FTP, gore, pornografía infantil, etc.) y el nivel 5 conforma lo que se denomina las Marianas Web (en referencia a la conocida fosa marina; y zona donde se puede entrar mediante el reconocido verso del “Closed Shell System“). Se alega que en éste, último nivel, se encuentra el %80 de la internet existente, teoría sustentada en la nada más absoluta. Es más realista pensar a la deep web como un grupo de páginas no enlistadas por buscadores populares. Siendo así, tal como en la superficie, hay sites más o menos legales, interesantes, funcionales o creíbles. No existe censura estrictamente desde ningún organismo y resulta sumamente interesante investigar sitios en busca de secretos gubernamentales, pero con un criterio mínimo en cuanto a la fiabilidad. Videos snuff Popularmente, se utiliza el término snuff para denominar a todo video que muestre una muerte real perpetrada con el fin de entretener al espectador. En todos los años que llevo andando por la red, nunca vi un sólo video que pudiera catalogarse de snuff. Incluso, el infame video Daisy’s destruction no es prueba suficiente -especialmente por la supuesta desaparición de la última parte, donde (se dice) asesinan a la protagonista. Lo más cercano a esta leyenda son los videos reales de accidentes, autopsias, etc. Algunos ejemplos destacables (y que recomiendo ampliamente) son las series Traces of Death, Banned from Television y Banned in America.

		"contents_": "It all began in 2016. We were just a \ngroup of fools looking for a way to get some cash. You know how it usually looks like - we invested \nsome cash on FOREX (and lost it), we invested some into Bitcoin (and took it out in a bad time), we \ntried pyramid schemes (and never suceeded). Some day one of us jumped onto TOR, we felt like we \nfinally found a gold machine: cloned cards, printed money, cheap drugs. But it wasn't so simple. We were ready to risk, we've done it \nbefore, we've lost our money many times already. But what happened then was ridiculous. Only one \nsingle order from seven that we've done happened to be legit. And it was a Fucking Glock 17. Even \ncocaine and marijuana didn't come. Owner of carding site sent us such a message: \"Another fucking \nidiot, you got SCAMMED\". We would never come back to TOR if this Glock wasn't real. But we've \nactually earned $150 on it because Glock 17 cost about $200 and we sold it for $350. Did you hear about placing credit \ncard skimmers on ATMs? We've heard about it on media, we were convinced that they have to sell all \nthose cards somewhere. Carders from first advert on TORCH scammed us but we tried to look deeper. We \nfound great TOR forum on Reddit, one user sent us its address. And here we bought the first working \ncloned card. Card got blocked after first transaction (and had a $100 transaction limit) but it \nhappened - \"IT'S REAL!!! LET'S GET FUCKING RICH\". You probably guess how we started, \nmaking little deals, buying cards, drugs. However, hunger grows fast. We wanted more cash. And we got \na proposal. \"I'll send you a package of 352 hacked PayPal accounts for 5 BTC\". We were discussing \nthis shit so hard, it was so risky. Yes, we bought it. Yes, it was REAL. Some of them were empty, \nsome of them with 5-10 dollars. Some of them with REAL BIG cash (up to $2000!). We couldn't cash it \nall out so we sold some of those accounts on the same forum we were buying stuff before. We \ntransformed into sellers. It grew pretty fast. We could \ncooperate with bigger clients, money we made we invested in real-life businesses so we were able to \nwash money earned in darknet. And here we are - we decided to join TORCH to break this fucking \nscamming market. We believe that good reputation may spread even to clearnet. We believe that we may \naffect all of this. We ain't hackers, we're still just a group of fools. But know we are Team \nFastransfers - because we're tired of scammers. Remember that using our services is illegal - you do \nit on your responsiblity. We've never heard about any of our clients having problems with law or \nbeing harassed by PayPal, Western Union or MoneyGram but you need to be cautious. Never get too loud \nabout money you get, jealous people may start to sniff.
